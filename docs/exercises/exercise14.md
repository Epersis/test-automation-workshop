# Exercise 14 - Bonus Exercises

## Run with test coverage

**"Test coverage"** is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. It helps to identify areas of the code that are not being tested.

Try running any of the unit tests with test coverage in [Test Explorer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/testing#_test-coverage).

## Create a GitLab CI Pipeline

As **GovTech** uses [SHIP-HATS](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/overview.html) ([GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)) for source code management, it would be handy to know how to create a [GitLab CI pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).

Here's a handy tutorial for creating your own [GitLab CI pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html).

You can refer to the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file [here](../../.gitlab-ci.yml) for a full example in SHIP-HATS GitLab CI.
